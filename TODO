Allow double quotes
For .md files, what is the HTML head? Add a way to specify page title (future: specify other info, such as scripts, styles, and desired template)
What about images in the source tree?
Better to have the site files outside the jar
Documentation and website
Add a "no server" mode which does not start up the server or the browser
Testing, particularly cross-browser and OS
Build final release distribution

The future:
templates, and more customization
use sxr
format other languages; run their scripts as well?
sbt integration
scales
look at unfiltered for the web server and knockoff for the markdown
think about how to deploy on a "real" server
