Do processing from menu (and setting of paths?)
Remove ProcessingFrame
One executable; no args or "-gui" starts gui on current directory (and in gui, setting the project root sets the output and classpath defaults)
Option to not insert consoles (for static web sites)
Why don't result numbers reset to 0?
Better to have the site files outside the jar; remove jsMath?
Testing, particularly cross-browser and OS
Build final release distribution

The future:
switch to SH 3.0, and make it work with AJAX
one-off downalation in interactive window? running tests?
more flexible way of handling tests
templates, and more customization
specify page title and other info (scripts, styles, etc.)
command to insert a tree (as in default index)
allow double quotes
use sxr
format other languages; run their scripts as well?
sbt integration
scales
look at unfiltered for the web server and knockoff for the markdown (MarkWrap? support Textile??)
think about how to deploy on a "real" server
