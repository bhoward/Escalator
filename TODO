Better to have the site files outside the jar
Testing, particularly cross-browser and OS
Build final release distribution

The future:
templates, and more customization
specify page title and other info (scripts, styles, etc.)
command to insert a tree (as in default index)
Allow double quotes
use sxr
format other languages; run their scripts as well?
sbt integration
scales
look at unfiltered for the web server and knockoff for the markdown (MarkWrap? support Textile??)
think about how to deploy on a "real" server
