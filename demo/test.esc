# Demo

Here is one version of the factorial function (\\(n!=1\\cdot2\\cdot\\ldots\\cdot n\\)),
defined using the `apply` method on a Scala object:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' <Factorial>

So that we can output the factorial of five...

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' <main>
...like that.

This is a console example:
//console example
import edu.depauw._
Factorial(5)
//end example

Here is the entire `test.scala` file:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala'

And here is just the `Factorial` object:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' 'object Factorial'

The `apply` method:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' 'object Factorial' / 'def apply'

And the `if` statement by itself:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' 'object Factorial' / 'def apply' / 'if'

Now, let's try for the `if` along with its `else` clause:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' 'object Factorial' / 'def apply' / 'if' - 'else'

This should get the apply method, including its type and return type:

//source 'edu/depauw/test.scala' object Factorial/def apply '(' Int ')' BigInt

This should get the `def` for `incImplicit`:

//source 'Values.scala' ~ inc

While this should get the `val` for `incAnonymous`:

//source 'Values.scala' val inc

Finally, here's one with a list of selectors:

//source 'Values.scala' val aString, val aDouble, def incImplicit

For example,
//example
import edu.depauw._

Factorial(5)

val f = ((x: Int) => x*x)
val x = 7

f(
x)

println('aSymbol) // let's see what happens... SyntaxHighlighter doesn't know about symbols
//end example

Now a [specs](http://code.google.com/p/specs/) test:
//test
"'hello world' has 11 characters" in {
  "hello world".size must be equalTo(11)
}
"'hello world' matches 'h.* w.*'" in {
  "hello world" must be matching("h.* w.*")
}
"test fails" in {
  2 + 2 must be equalTo(5)
}
"factorial of 5 is 120" in {
  Factorial(5) must be equalTo(120)
}
//end test

Escalator will capture output sent to the console as well as showing
the expression result, just like the REPL:
//example
println("Here is some console output")
//end example
